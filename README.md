This repository contains following tasks:

## 1.Movie Genre Prediction

  I have created a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a
movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. I have used techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers
such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines. <br>
The dataset can be accessed from [Kaggle- Movie Genre](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hijest/genre-classification-dataset-imdb)



## 2.Credit Card Fraud Detection

I have built a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Used a
dataset containing information about credit card transactions, and
experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees,
or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or
legitimate.<br>
The dataset can be accessed from [Kaggle- Credit Card](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection)


## 3.Spam SMS Detection

I have built an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or
legitimate using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with
classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector
Machines to identify spam messages.<br>
The dataset can be accessed from [Kaggle- Spam SMS](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)

## 4.Handwritten Text Generation
  Implement a character-level recurrent neural network (RNN) to
generate handwritten-like text. Train the model on a dataset of
handwritten text examples, and let it generate new text based on
the learned patterns.<br>
The dataset can be accessed from [Text Generation](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/iam)
